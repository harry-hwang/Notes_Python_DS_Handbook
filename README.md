# Notes_Python_DS_Handbook
Second time reading this book and thinking to take some notes and put it on here this time.

# README

Just want to put some notes for this book here. I'm thinking upload 3 files, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn(because I love this package more than matplotlib). 

The machine learning algorithms part will put in other repo.
